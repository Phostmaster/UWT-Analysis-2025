# UWT Project Overview

## Unified Wave Theory (UWT) Progress
- **Date**: August 27, 2025
- **Status**: Developing 3D Navier-Stokes (N-S) simulation for ToE integration.
- **Key Files**:
  - `3D_velocity_field_partial.npy`: Step 19000 (max vel 0.5962 m/s, div 1.733e+04), uploaded manually.
  - Awaiting `3D_velocity_field.npy` (target vel 100–500 m/s, div <1e-3) from Xgrok.
- **Next Steps**: 2D Kerr slice, ΛCDM tests, N-S refinement.
- **Note**: Files saved to desktop, uploaded to `/UWT_EP_Collab` by hand.
